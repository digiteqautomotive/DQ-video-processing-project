MODULE				: Fifo

TAG						: FIFO

FILE NAME			: Fifo.h

DESCRIPTION		: A class to hold a fifo buffer in the form of an array with type double. 
                Add to the head, shuffle down and remove from the tail. Keep a running sum
                of the fifo contents as this is a commonly required function.
