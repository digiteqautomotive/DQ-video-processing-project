MODULE				: IMotionVectorPredictor

TAG						: IMVP

FILE NAME			: IMotionVectorPredictor.h

DESCRIPTION		: An interface to class implementations that predict the motion
                vector for the current macroblock/block from the surrounding
                previously encoded/decoded motion vectors.
