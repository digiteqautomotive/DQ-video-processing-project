MODULE				: BitStreamBase

TAG						: BSB

FILE NAME			: BitStreamBase.h

DESCRIPTION		: A base class to contain a contiguous mem array to be bit accessible. The 
                mem is not owned by the class. Derived classes handle the reading and writing, 
								BitStreamReader and BitStreamWriter.
