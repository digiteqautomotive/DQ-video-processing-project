MODULE						: IMotionCompensator

TAG								: IMC

FILE NAME					: IMotionCompensator.h

DESCRIPTION				: An interface to motion compensator implementations. 
										VectorList objects are compensated to a YUV420
										image ref.

REVISION HISTORY	:	25/09/2006 (KF): A single vector mode was added to
										the interface to allow one vector at a time to be 
										compensated. This requires an overload for the
										Compensate() method and a new method PrepareForSingleVectorMode()
										for dumping the ref into temp before compensating.

										29/09/2006 (KF): Removed the reference to VectorList objects
										to allow any structured object in the interface. The
										implementations will now define the list structure.
