MODULE: ICodecInnerAccess

TAG: ICIA

FILE NAME: ICodecInnerAccess.h

DESCRIPTION: 
A ICodecInnerAccess Interface as an optional base class 
to expose the inner members of all video and audio codecs.
The destructor is protected to prevent deletion	of the 
associated super class. NOTE: These methods should only
be called after an Open() call on the ICodecv2 interface.
